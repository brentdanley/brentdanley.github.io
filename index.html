<p>This is a site, built with Jekyll, that showcases the various projects in <a href="https://github.com/brentdanley" title="Brent Danley's GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>. Each post is essentially the README for the corresponding project. This is primarily for prospective employers looking to see code samples and get an idea of the technologies I've used throughout my career.</p>
<p>These are all personal projects, and most of them are "weekend" demo projects built entirely for fun or to demonstrate a skill or competency. Professional projects to which I've contributed are on the respective company accounts and not included here.</p>
